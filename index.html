                Thanks for visiting LINEART_V1.0<br> 
                <br>
                I am <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicksaidhey/" style="color:rgb(248, 38, 56);">Nick</a>. A beginner of creative coding art. 
                This is a beginning version of this digital art. As you will see, there's a group of lines is "breathing" down there.. <br> 
                <br>
                You can change the numbers of lines, the size of the main breating body and the color the body by playing around with the sliders and the color picker. <br>
                <br>
                While you are having fun with it (let me assume that you like it.. ^_^), if you find the tools are not at the right position, please re-fresh the page to reset it. But you might will lose the previous seetings... <br>
                Sorry for the inconvenience. I am still working on it! <br>
                <br>
                Druing the coding, I had met some technique porblems. One of them is, how to duplicate this figure many times with a given gap. I tried a few ways but at the end I smashed the whole picture... Very sad story. <br>
                <br>
                I am looking for feedbacks if you want to comment on this project, please <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicksaidhey/" style="color:rgb(248, 38, 56);">DM</a> me through my instagram. I will be very thankful for your advices. Enjoy!
